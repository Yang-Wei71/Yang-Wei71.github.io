  <h1> 10 things you might want to consider eating</h1>
  <h3> Rust, Tennis ball fuzz and Castor oil????</h3>
  <em style = 'color: grey;'>Written by Erarrat on 24 October 2019</em>
  
  
  <h4> 1. Rust</h4>
  <p>Iron(III) Oxide, commonly dubbed the moniker 'rust' is probably the one most people will tell you to try. The red, flaky solid gives an interesting texture as well as an iron-y taste. The first person recorded to eat this noble food was Jacques Le'Mater but the habit was further popularized by English Reverend Robert Ryan</p>
  <h4> 2. Silicone</h4>
  <p> Ahhh...Where to begin on this one. The tasty polymer has a variety of uses including, but not limited to sealants, lubricants and insulation. But suprisingly this multipurpose material bears a unique and rich taste. Often described as a sour-salty with a hint of cinnamon smell, the discovery of silicone being edible is a relatively recent one. A post an famous imageboard 4chan first started this trend, with many joining and the practice spreading to other social media such as MySpace and Frendster</p>
  <h4> 3. Cereal boxes</h4>
  <p> It may come as a surprise to you but the colourful containers of our celebrated cereals(aliteration!) are acually quite edible. This is because, to withstand the rigours of being transported across the world, the cardboard is infused with a special chemical known as, Triglomerate SC. The special compound, although poisonous in large quantities, gives the cereal boxes a sweet scent and a feeling of euphoria when consumed. No one knows how this compound works or how the ritual of eating it came to be, but the habit is now gaining considerable poularity on streets like Tchoupitoulas Street</p>
  <h4> 4.Mercury</h4>
  <p> Proceed with caution on this one. The antediluvian adage that mercury is deadly is still true, unless of course, you bear the gene CXCL23 which provides a resistance to the poisonous element. </p>
  <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTyw_ZJQGjk'> You can check whether you're immune to mercury here!</a>
  <h4>5. Marvin Gaye's What's Going On</h4>
  <p>This album is widely deemed as Marvin Gaye's magnum opus. The album ranks first on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Album of all time(2020). However, what most are unaware of is that the CD edition, released in 2002, which features two new bonus tracks, is actually edible </p>

  </img>
<p>This CD has been described as having a taste like "fried peas". Please consume with caution though, eating too much can cause severe and irreversible damage to the digestive system</p>
<h4>6. Tennis ball fuzz</h4> 
<p> I'll admit, this one's a little unusual. But tennis ball fuzz may be a great edition to your 3 meals. To many (including me), there's no better start to a day then having a nice cuppa as well as some tennis ball fuzz. However not all fuzz are created equal. below is a table on which one I think is best</p>

<h4> 7. Adam Sandler</h4>

<p> Yes, famous TikTok celebrity Adam Sandler is edible. No, I won't tell you how I know that</p>
<h4> 8. Toenail Clippings</h4>
<p> I'm salivating at the thought of this one. Toenail clippings may seem disgusting, but it is actuallly very safe and consuming them is a practice that dates back to sixth century Mesopotamia. Made of Keratin, the same material that hair is made up of, toenail clippings are 100% safe for consumption. Consuming them also 'recycles' the keratin, promoting hair growth. </p>
<h4>9. Castor oil</h4>
<p> The overused scene in cartoons where the cartoon character is fed castor oil is nothing but false. Why? Because instead of swallowing it reluctantly, these characters should be begging for more. Reddit user GallowBoob describes the taste as 'oily(duh) and masculine, with the familiar taste of the castor beans the oil was made from. The pungent smell makes up most of the taste. However, there are hints of parsely, sage, rosemary and thyme.'</p>

<h4>10. Babies</h4>

<p> And finally, babies, the very start of human life. I always find it kind of poetic that we are consuming the very start of life </p>
<h3> Just kidding of course!!!</h3>

<p> Number 10 is actually cacti, although it may seem like a bad idea to consume that could potentially have lasting and servere impact on your digestive system. Eating cacti, or eacting as it is commonly known as , provides a large quantity and variety of nutrients that is not limited to</p>
